				Rules Explained
			</div>
			The following is a detailed outline of each of the rules for the server and a punishment for 
			breaking them. <br /> <br />
			If someone breaks a rule but there is no appropriate punishment the staff have final say 
			on the punishment.

			<div class="boardtitle">
				Rdming (rule 1)
			</div>
			
			<div class="boardtitlesmall">
				Description
			</div>
			
			<p>
				Rdm (random deathmatch) is when you start killing or attack someone without sufficient evidence. 
				This is a major problem in TTT as the game depends on people following the rules. Rdm 
				is not only done with weapons, it can be done with any item that can damage or cause a players 
				death, such as props and traps.
				
			</p>

			<p>
				Rdm has little to do with whether or not you were right about them being a traitor, 
				it has to do with whether or not the kill was justified, its possible to rdm a traitor 
				and its possible for an innocent to be justified in killing an innocent. Attempted rdm
				still counts as rdm and will be punished accordingly. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
					You can kill people for things that generally are only justifiable to do as a traitor, this includes.
				<ol>
					<li>Killing people without a good reason.</li>
					<li>Carrying traitor weapons without giving a good reason for having one.</li>
					<li>Walking by, hiding or burning unidentified bodies.</li>
					<li>Doing things to help the traitors such as moving unidentified bodies.</li>
					<li>Moving bodies to prevent DNA collection.</li>
					<li>Placing or activating traps in an attempt to kill people.</li>
					<li>Breaking health stations.</li>
					<li>Breaking the traitor tester when you are not proven innocent.</li>

				</ol>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Generally the best way to avoid accidental rdm is to use your head. 
				If you don't know why two people are shooting at each other then stay out of it. 
				Let them fight it out and give the winner a chance to identify the body. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There is also the general understanding that things happen fast and honest 
				mistakes or misinterpretations shouldn't get you punished. 
				However staff have the final say if you really felt that you were about to 
				be killed or whether you were looking for an excuse to kill people.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Be aware that killing on suspicion is never allowed and that you may 
				always defend yourself as long as you didn't start the fight. 
			</p>
			
			<div class="boardtitlesmall">
				Punishments
			</div>
			
			Each rdm: 1 slay <br /><br />
			Each  rdm and leave: 1 day ban <br /><br />
			Damaging without trying to kill: slap for twice the damage <br /><br />
			Mass rdm (3 rdms in a round or rdming 3 rounds in a row): Permanent ban.<br /><br />
			
			<br /><br />
			
			<b>Any rdm done to traitors results in twice the punishment.</b>

				Ghosting (rule 2)
			</div>
			
			<div class="boardtitlesmall">
				Description
			</div>
			
			<p>
				Ghosting is using any method of communication outside of Garrysmod voice and text chat to 
				provide other players information about the game they don't already know. Please be aware 
				that admin chat goes to all staff in game, not just the dead ones, therefore it is possible 
				to accidently ghost over admin chat.
			</p>
			
			<br />
			
			<div class="boardtitlesmall">
				Punishments
			</div>
			
			Ghosting is unacceptable, anyone caught intentionally ghosting will be permanently banned. <br /><br />

				Live Checks (rule 3)
			</div>
			
			<div class="boardtitlesmall">
				Description
			</div>
			
			<p>
				If you suspect that people are dead you can call a live check. After 3 live checks 
				spaced at least 5 seconds apart you may kill anyone that doesn't respond.
				
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If only one person responds to a live check that doesn't mean that you can kill the 
				only person to respond. Its always possible that the last traitor didn't respond to 
				the live check.
				
			</p>
			
			<br />
			
			<div class="boardtitlesmall">
				Punishments
			</div>
			
			Kills as the result of an invalid live check count as rdm and will be punished as such.

				person following you. Warnings on a player reset after they stop following you.

				then they will probably continue heading where they were.
