				Rules Explained
			</div>
			The following is a detailed outline of each of the rules for the server and a punishment for 
			breaking them. <br /> <br />
			If someone breaks a rule but there is no appropriate punishment the staff have final say 
			on the punishment.

			<div class="boardtitle">
				Spawn Camping (rule 1)
			</div>
			
			<div class="boardtitlesmall">
				Description
			</div>
			
			<p> 
				Garrysmod spawn protection is lacking, so players need to do their part in 
				making sure they don't camp the spawns, and give players a fair chance to spawn in 
				before killing them.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When someone spawns they originally have spawn protection, until they fire their gun, 
				or for three seconds they don't take damage. While in spawn protection the playermodel 
				turns blue. If you can see someone while they are blue then you should not be shooting 
				at them and should move away from their spawn.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This server also has custom spawn protection, when a player spawns they have 3 seconds 
				where killing them serves no benefit. Killing a player who has been alive for less 
				than 3 seconds will not rank you up. You will also receive an automatic warning for 
				camping the spawn. 
			</p>
			
			
			<div class="boardtitlesmall">
				Punishments
			</div>
			
			You will be warned by staff to get out of the spawns, when you are warned you are to 
			take immediate action to get out of the spawn. Not listening to the staff will result 
			in a 5 rank demotion.
			
			<br /><br />
			
			After 3 warnings by the staff to get out of a spawn your rank will be set back to 1.
			
			<br /> <br />
			
			The warnings from the automated anti spawn camping script are separate from the ones from 
			staff members, the warnings from the script are harder to get and are not based on human 
			judgement, but actually killing someone when you were in the spawn. After 3 automated warnings 
			you will be demoted by 5 ranks each time you kill a player who has been alive less than 
			3 seconds. On your 6th warning you will be automatically kicked.
