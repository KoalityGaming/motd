				Staff Guidelines
			</div>
			Staff members are expected to follow these guidlines while on any Koality servers.
			<br />
			<br />
			This list is kept public so that members can know that the staff is treating them in a 
			fair way.

				Your influence on the game
			</div>
			
			<p>
				In short staff has no impact on how you play the game. Being staff does not mean 
				that you get special guns or that you are above the rules in any way.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				ULX commands and your authority should not be an advantage over you in the game. You need 
				to play the game like you are any normal player without staff powers.

				Punishing players
			</div>
			
			This motd includes a detailed rules section, it outlines every rule and the punishments 
			for breaking them. Staff members can decrease a punishment at their discretion but are 
			not allowed to increase punishments from the ones listed. If there is no punishment that 
			appropriately fits the way the rule was broken the staff member may create a punishment. 
			Any punishment created by a staff member may not exceed a one week ban.

			<div class="boardtitlesmall">
				Let players explain themselves. 
			</div>
			
			<p>
				Before punishing a user you must give them at least 30 seconds to explain themselves. 
				Use both voice and text chat and consider jailing them to get their attention.
			</p>

				Following the rules
			</div>
			
			<p>
				Staff members are expected to be ideal members of the community, as such they are expected 
				to always follow the rules of the server. Staff members who knowingly break the rules will
				be demoted and have an appropriate punishment applied to them. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Mistakes will happen, a staff member might accidently rdm or break another rule. Everyone 
				makes mistakes and staff won't be demoted because they screwed up once. However they 
				are expected to punish themselves. If a staff member refuses to punish themself even 
				though they know they broke a rule they will be demoted.
			
			</p>

			<div class="boardtitlesmall">
				Treatement of players
			</div>
			
			<p>
				Staff members need to apply the rules fairly, if your friend rdms someone you don't 
				like you need to set that aside for the punishment, or have someone else punish them.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Staff members are in a position of power, if you let that power go to your head 
				then you won't be staff for long. Any staff member who starts harassing a player or 
				targeting them will lose staff. If you find yourself looking for reasons to punish 
				someone then we have a problem. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There are going to be members that you don't like and you're likely going to get in 
				an argument at some point. Take your issues somewhere else, I don't care if you didn't 
				start the fight, I expect you to be the mature one and end it, or take it elsewhere. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I want Koality to be a friendly community, the actions of the staff are a huge part 
				of that. I don't want staff flaunting their power or threatening members. 
				If two players join and you notice they are friends that doesn't mean that you accuse 
				them of ghosting. If someone has a high pitched voice you are welcome to mute them 
				on your end, but don't insult them and don't gag them for it.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Your number of bans isn't a badge of honour, we want members, not people getting banned. 
				Punish them as appropriate, but don't go out of your way to find a reason. When you 
				need to tell someone to stop doing something try asking them nicely first, you don't 
				need to start off talking down at them or ordering them around. The words please and thank you go 
				a long way, and if you treat someone with respect they're more likely to listen to you.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				At the end of the day, realize that you're staff on a Garrysmod server, not a god.
