					Senior Admin
			</div>
			Senior Admin is essentially a feature addition for our most active admins. 
			It recognizes the most dedication to the server and comes with a few basic perks.
			The main perk is that give that user the ability to set their custom scoreboard color.
			They are also given access to the youtube music player.

			Admin provides all the necessary features to help run the server. There are few restrictions 
			on their power because they have at least 4 months of experience as a member of Koality.

				Moderator
			</div>
			Moderator is the first staff rank on Koality. It comes with limits on ban time and only provides 
			the essential commands for running the server. It is largely a trial rank, after no less than 
			one month Admins will vote whether to promote, demote or leave them in this rank.
		</div>
		
		<div class="board">
			<div class="boardtitle">
				Trusted
			</div>
			Trusted is given to people who have been on the server long enough to gain our trust. 
			It essentially means that we trust you to represent the server well when no staff are on. 
			Trusted is not a staff rank, but it has some semi staff like features that can only be used 
			when no staff members are on. When you get trusted you are allowed to apply for moderator 
			on the forums.

				Member
			</div>
			Member doesn't offer too much, but its a recognition that you're an official member of the community. 
			Getting member will allow you spectate props, you can get it by joining the website and steam group.
